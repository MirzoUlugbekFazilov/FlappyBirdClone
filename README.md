# FlappyBirdClone
A Flappy Bird clone was built using HTML and JavaScript Phaser 3. Features smooth physics, random obstacles, scoring, and dynamic difficulty levels. Fly with spacebar, restart with R, and reach the end to win. A fun project was created to learn game development basics with JavaScript and Phaser.
